Networking
==========

Network configuration is critical for HPC cluster performance. Proper setup, tuning, and monitoring ensure optimal
communication between nodes.

**Consistency is Key**: All measurements across message sizes should show smooth performance curves. Irregular patterns
typically indicate configuration problems with the network or system.
