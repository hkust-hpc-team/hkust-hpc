External Validation
====================

External validation establishes system performance relative to published results from other HPC centers, vendors, and research institutions. These standardized benchmarks provide comparative context: "Is our performance competitive with similar systems?"

(Content to be developed: benchmark selection, published result sources, interpretation guidelines, runtime trade-offs)
