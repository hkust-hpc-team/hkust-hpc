This is a collection of articles and solutions for supported software and services on
HKUST central clusters, including common errors, issues, best practices, how-tos, and

Solving common technical issues
-------------------------------

If you encounter an error when using central cluster, please try to search for the
**error message printed by the command** using the *Search docs* feature on the top left
corner of the page.

As an example, if you encounter the following error message when using the command ``ssh
superpod``

.. code-block:: shell-session

    user@my-pc ~]$ ssh superpod
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname superpod: Name or service not known

You may try to search for ``Could not resolve hostname`` or ``Name or service not
known``.
