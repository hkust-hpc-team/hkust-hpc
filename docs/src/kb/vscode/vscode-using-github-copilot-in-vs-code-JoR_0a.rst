    - How can I use GitHub Copilot into Visual Studio Code?

Prerequisites
-------------

Before installing GitHub Copilot, ensure you have:

1. **Active GitHub Copilot Subscription**

   - Individual subscription (pricing varies by region, check GitHub's current rates)
   - GitHub Copilot for Business (for organizations)
   - GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise Cloud subscription
   - Student access through GitHub Student Developer Pack
   - Free trial (if available)

   .. note::

       Pricing may vary by region and is subject to change. Visit `GitHub Copilot
       pricing page <https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing>`_ for current rates.

2. **Visual Studio Code**

   - Version 1.74.0 or later (recommended: latest stable version)
   - Version 1.99.0+ required for GitHub Copilot Agent mode features
   - Download from `official VS Code website <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_

   .. tip::

       While older versions may work for basic Copilot features, VS Code 1.99+ provides
       enhanced Agent mode capabilities and better Copilot integration.

3. **Internet Connection**

   - Stable internet connection for extension download and AI suggestions

Installation Steps
------------------

Method 1: Install via VS Code Extensions Marketplace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Open VS Code**

   Launch Visual Studio Code on your system.

2. **Access Extensions Panel**

   - Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
   - Or use keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl+Shift+X`` (Windows/Linux) or ``Cmd+Shift+X``
     (macOS)

3. **Search for GitHub Copilot**

   - Type "GitHub Copilot" in the search box
   - Look for the official extension published by "GitHub"

4. **Install the Extension**

   - Click the "Install" button next to "GitHub Copilot"
   - Wait for the installation to complete

5. **Install GitHub Copilot Chat (Optional but Recommended)**

   - Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat"
   - Install this companion extension for enhanced chat features

Method 2: Install via Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer command-line installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install GitHub Copilot extension
    code --install-extension GitHub.copilot

    # Install GitHub Copilot Chat extension (optional)
    code --install-extension GitHub.copilot-chat

Configuration and Setup
-----------------------

1. **Sign in to GitHub**

   - After installation, VS Code will prompt you to sign in
   - Click "Sign in to GitHub" when prompted
   - Complete the authentication process in your browser
   - Return to VS Code to complete the setup

2. **Verify Installation**

   - Open a code file (e.g., ``.py``, ``.js``, ``.cpp``)
   - Start typing code and look for Copilot suggestions (gray text)
   - Suggestions should appear automatically as you type

3. **Configure Settings (Optional)**

   Access settings via ``Ctrl+,`` (Windows/Linux) or ``Cmd+,`` (macOS):

   .. code-block:: json

       {
           "github.copilot.enable": {
               "*": true,
               "yaml": false,
               "plaintext": false
           },
           "github.copilot.inlineSuggest.enable": true,
           "github.copilot.editor.enableAutoCompletions": true
       }

Important Considerations
------------------------

Version Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **VS Code Minimum Version**: 1.74.0 for basic features, 1.99.0+ for Agent mode
- **Node.js**: Not directly required, but some features may need Node.js 18.x or later
- **Extension Updates**: Enable automatic updates for the latest features and security
  patches

.. note::

    GitHub Copilot Agent mode (available in VS Code 1.99+) provides enhanced
    conversational capabilities and improved code understanding.

Performance Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Memory Usage**: Copilot may increase VS Code's memory consumption by 100-200MB
- **Network Usage**: Requires constant internet connection for AI suggestions
- **CPU Impact**: Minimal CPU overhead during normal operation

Security and Privacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Code Privacy**: Your code is sent to GitHub's servers for processing
- **Data Retention**: GitHub may retain code snippets for service improvement
- **Enterprise Setup**: Consider GitHub Copilot for Business for enhanced privacy
  controls

Troubleshooting
---------------

Common Issues and Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Issue: Copilot not showing suggestions**

1. Check your GitHub Copilot subscription status
